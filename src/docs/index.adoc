== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Contact Management Reports Plugin

The +crm-contact-pdf+ plugin is a companion plugin to plugins +crm-contact+ and +crm-contact-ui+.
It provides PDF reports for contact management.

Printing and exporting data in a {gr8crm} application is event based.
When a user decides to export or print data a layout selection page is displayed.
But before this page is displayed the application event +exportLayout+ is sent.
The namespace for this event is the (property) name of the domain class that wants to be exported/printed.
For example: If a user wants to export or print contacts using the +crm-contact-ui+ plugin the event that is
sent is +namespace=crmContact+, +topics=exportLayout+.

Application or plugin code that supports exporting the data type specified by namespace replies to the event with
metadata about supported layouts. The layout selection page aggregates all replies and render a list of
layouts that the user can pick from.

Once the user has selected a layout a new event is sent. The event payload is the metadata that was replied in the first event.
The listener that listens to this event renders the report and return a temporary file with report/export output.
This temporary file is then sent to the user's browser.

This event based approach makes it easy to add more layouts with zero configuration.
As a developer you just have to create an event listener that replies to the +exportLayout+ event
and then listen for rendering events. Plugins or applications code can provide report layouts
for any domain class in a simple and elegant way.

== Report Layouts

This section describes each report layout provided by the +crm-contact-pdf+ plugin.

=== Contact List

A simple contact/address list if portrait A4 format.

== Custom Report example

The following code example shows how you could create a Grails Service that provides a new report layout (address list).

[source,groovy]
.MyReportService.groovy
----
class MyReportService {

    def grailsLinkGenerator
    def pdfRenderingService

    @Listener(namespace = "crmContact", topic = "exportLayout")
    def exportLayout(data) {
        return [name: 'Address List', description: 'Simple address list in A4 portrait',
                thumbnail: grailsLinkGenerator.resource(dir: 'images', file: 'address-thumbnail.png'), // <1>
                contentType: 'application/pdf', namespace: 'crmContact', topic: 'print-simple']
    }

    @Listener(namespace = "crmContact", topic = "print-simple") // <2>
    def print(params) {
        def tempFile = File.createTempFile("crm", ".pdf")
        tempFile.deleteOnExit()

        // Render PDF report to a temporary file
        tempFile.withOutputStream { outputStream ->
            pdfRenderingService.render(template: "addresslist", plugin: "my-reports", controller: "crmContact",
                    model: [result: result], outputStream) // <3>
        }
        [file: tempFile, filename: 'Address List', contentType: 'application/pdf']
    }
}
----
<1> A thumbnail image of the report layout is stored as *web-app/images/address-thumbnail.png*.
<2> Namespace and topic must match what was sent in the *exportLayout* reply above.
<3> The report template is *grails-app/views/crmContact/_addresslist.gsp* in plugin *my-reports*.
